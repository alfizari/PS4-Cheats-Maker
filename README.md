# 🎮 PS4-Cheats-Maker  

An easy-to-use app for working with **Save Wizard quick codes** and **custom scripts** for PS4 game saves.  
It accepts decrypted saves, knowing the CUSA is required. It will treat different CUSA's for the same game as one.

## ➕ Adding Quick Codes  

You can add Quick Codes in two ways:  

1. **Directly via JSON**  
   Add them to the JSON file following the same structure:

2. **Using the App UI**

## ⬆️ Uploading Scripts  

- **Lua** and **Python** scripts must be **zipped with 7z** and uploaded to GitHub following the correct naming format.  
- Quick codes are stored in the **JSON file**.  

---

## ⚙️ Built-In Functions  

- Do **not** delete or modify existing functions.  
- To add new ones:  
  - Add the function logic here → [helpers.py](https://github.com/alfizari/PS4-Cheats-Maker/blob/main/helpers.py)  
  - Add the function name here → [built_in_functions.json](https://github.com/alfizari/PS4-Cheats-Maker/blob/main/built_in_functions.json)  

💡 You can debug directly in the app terminal with:  
```python
print("your message here")
```

---

## 🐍 Running the Script Natively  

You need **Python 3** installed.  

**Dependencies:**  
- tkinter  
- asyncio  
- lupa  
- requests  
- py7zr  

Install them via pip:  
```bash
pip install tkinter asyncio lupa requests py7zr
```

## 📦 Building an Executable
